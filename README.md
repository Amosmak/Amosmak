- 👋 Hi, I’m @Amosmak
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering the latest Software Engineering and Developer trends, tools and ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently still deciding what to learn because I am not a Software Engineer by training. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on career opportunities because I am a Tech Recruiter.
- 📫 How to reach me, my email is amos@thegreatfit.com
